  "summary": "REQ-49 is largely implemented: the “Why I Love You” modal now has a darker/blurred backdrop overlay plus a dedicated high-contrast dark panel behind each sequentially-fading line, with internal scrolling and correct click-outside-to-close behavior. One constraint appears unaddressed: respecting prefers-reduced-motion for the modal animations/timed fade-ins.",

      "id": "REQ-49",
      "requirement": "Keep the app mobile-first and ensure changes respect prefers-reduced-motion where applicable (especially for modal animations / sequential fade-ins).",
      "reason": "The modal still applies animation classes (e.g., animate-fade-in, animate-scale-in) and uses timed sequential reveals via setTimeout without any conditional handling for reduced-motion users in the shown changes.",

      "reason": "REQ-49/ACs require the modal body to be scrollable and usable, but do not explicitly request global body scroll locking; this is an additional behavior beyond the stated requirements.",
