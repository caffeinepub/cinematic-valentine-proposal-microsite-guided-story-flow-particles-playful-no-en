  "summary": "Luxury cinematic, emotionally immersive, fully mobile-responsive interactive Valentine proposal microsite titled “Dear Fatima urf Meethadil — Will You Be My Valentine?” with guided storytelling flow, glassmorphism UI, particle/animation effects, playful NO button engine, modals, slides, celebration sequence, audio toggles, plus a final-screen floating Promise Scroll (3 swipeable promises) and enhanced animations across the entire final screen—now also including a full-screen 3D heart “entering my heart” loading/intro scene before the typing intro, and a second 3D heart zoom transition after YES with on-screen text—targeting a standard production Vite React build (index.html references built /assets bundles) to resolve the blank white screen issue.",
  "architectural_notes": [
    "Single deployable HTML file containing all HTML/CSS/JS; must work offline (no external runtime dependencies).",
    "Mobile-first responsive layout with lightweight, optimized animations (use requestAnimationFrame / CSS animations; respect reduced-motion where possible).",
    "Audio should be user-initiated (toggle) for mobile autoplay restrictions; keep volume levels subtle.",
    "New opening scene required: full-screen heart-loading/zoom animation before typing intro; must fade into existing intro automatically.",
    "After YES click, add a second heart-zoom transition (deeper) showing exact text: “Getting more deeper in my heart”.",
    "3D heart must be implemented as a real Three.js / React Three Fiber 3D heart model (offline-capable, bundled locally).",
    "Deployment decision: use standard production Vite React build (Option 1) with index.html referencing compiled /assets/*.js bundles; do not load /src/main.tsx in production.",
    "Decision: recreate the entire frontend as a proper standard Vite React project (with Vite config + dist build output) and redeploy dist/index.html + dist/assets/* so production no longer serves /src/main.tsx.",
    "NO button movement should trigger only on click/tap (not on hover), while preserving existing NO-button engine behaviors.",
    "On NO click/tap, flash the caption text “Itni aasani se NO nahi bol sakti 🙂” once (brief attention animation)."

  "known_issues": [
    "Site shows a blank white page immediately on load (from first frame).",

    "Deployed HTML source still contains `<script type=\"module\" src=\"/src/main.tsx\"></script>`, indicating the production deployment is serving the dev entry instead of the Vite build output (dist).",
    "NO button can overlap the YES button, “Why I Love You” button, and/or the caption, making controls hard to use.",
    "“Why I Love You” modal content is not readable because it overlaps other elements (layering/responsive layout issue).",
