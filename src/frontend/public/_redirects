# Production Static Hosting Redirect Rules
# 
# These rules ensure proper SPA routing, asset serving, and security in production.
# Supported by: Netlify, Vercel, Cloudflare Pages, and other modern static hosts.

# 1. Block source files from being served in production (security)
#    Any request to /src/* should return 404, not fall back to index.html
/src/*     /404.html     404

# 2. Static assets must NEVER be rewritten to index.html
#    This is critical: /assets/* paths should be served as files or return 404
#    Without this rule, missing assets would return HTML, causing MIME type errors
/assets/*  /assets/:splat  200

# 3. API and special paths (if needed in future)
/api/*     /api/:splat     200

# 4. SPA fallback for navigation routes (MUST be last)
#    All other paths (non-file requests) fall back to index.html for client-side routing
#    This enables routes like /proposal, /celebration, etc. to work
/*         /index.html     200
